Notes:
------
* I have chosen not to use too many 3rd party libraries (Retrofit, ButterKnife, Parcelable, AutoValue etc ) 
in order to comply to this requirement: 
            ([...]We want to see what YOU can do but feel free to use any libraries or frameworks needed.)
* I am aware I haven't employed a TDD approach, and more tests would be needed; but this was due to my limited time.
