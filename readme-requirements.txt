Code Test: A&F Promotional Card
--------------------------------------------

Write a simple Android application using Google’s Material Design based on the A&F Promotions feed 
(www.abercrombie.com/anf/nativeapp/Feeds/promotions.json). The app should launch into a table view with:

* An image thumbnail (or place holder image) related to the promotion – “image” attribute from the feed. 
* The title of the promotion – “title” attribute from the feed. 
* Clicking a row should take you to a second view that will present a promotion card:
* An image (or place holder image) related to the promotion – “image” attribute from the feed. 
* The title of the promotion – “title” attribute from the feed. 
* A description of the promotion – “description” attribute from the feed. 
* A footer of the promotion – “footer” attribute from the feed. 
* A button – “button” attribute from the feed. 
* Clicking on a button in the promotional card a user will be redirected to a webview that corresponds to the “target” attribute of the button.
